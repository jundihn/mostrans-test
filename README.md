# Mostrans Test Project

This project is a test application built with React.js and deployed using Vercel. It interacts with the Rick and Morty API to fetch and display character data, allowing users to assign characters to specific locations.

## Features

- Character Assignment: Assign characters to different locations with a unique name for each location.
- Character Display: View characters assigned to each location with their details fetched from the Rick and Morty API.
- Persistent Data: The application stores location and character data in the browser's localStorage to maintain state across page reloads.
